# HTML Resume

This repository contains a minimal **HTML-based resume** maintained as part of my GitHub portfolio.

The project originally started as a beginner exercise while learning basic web development fundamentals (HTML), and was later updated to reflect my **current professional profile** as I transition toward analytics engineering and more technical data roles.

## Purpose

- Present my resume in a simple, structured, and readable HTML format
- Demonstrate comfort with clean markup and documentation
- Complement data-focused portfolio projects with a lightweight front-end artifact

## Notes

- This is intentionally **minimal** and framework-free
- No advanced CSS or JavaScript is used
- The focus is on clarity, structure, and content rather than visual design
